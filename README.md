# PhotoStack Classic

PhotoStack Classic is a variant of [PhotoStack](https://github.com/photostack/photostack) intended for use with legacy web browsers and platforms, including Internet Explorer (10+), Edge on Windows 10 Mobile, and Safari on unsupported iOS devices. If the new PhotoStack web app detects a browser lacks required features, like Promises support, the user is automatically redirected to PhotoStack Classic.

PhotoStack Classic is based on PhotoStack 1.x, with some features and interface improvements backported from newer PhotoStack versions. Watermark files are cross-compatible between both versions, and can be created and exported as needed.

PhotoStack Classic uses components from [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/), [canvas-toBlob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/canvas-toBlob.js), [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/), and [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/). The icon was designed by [Mason Conrad](https://twitter.com/MasNConrad).
