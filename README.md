# PhotoStack Classic

PhotoStack Classic is a variant of [PhotoStack](https://github.com/photostack/photostack) intended for use with legacy web browsers and platforms, including Internet Explorer (10+), Edge on Windows 10 Mobile, and Safari on unsupported iOS devices. If the new PhotoStack web app detects a browser lacks required features, like Promises support, the user is automatically redirected to PhotoStack Classic.

PhotoStack Classic is based on PhotoStack 1.x, with some features and interface improvements backported from PhotoStack 2.x. Watermark files created with newer versions of PhotoStack can be imported in Classic, and vice-versa.

PhotoStack Classic uses components from [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/), [canvas-toBlob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/canvas-toBlob.js), [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/), and [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/). Icon is from the [Oranchelo icon theme](https://github.com/OrancheloTeam/oranchelo-icon-theme).
